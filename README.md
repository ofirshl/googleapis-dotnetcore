# Manychois.GoogleApis
This is a project to provide a .Net Core client libraries for certain Google APIs.

Here are the Google APIs I currently cover:
- Google AdWords (v201906)

## Motivation
Google does not provide a .Net Core client library for its APIs. Instead of a simple port from an existing .Net library, I try to rewrite the whole thing (or reinvent the wheel if you like) in hope of providing a better C# coding experience.
